# Miniplat

Sandbox project to practice SDL2, CMake and C++.

## Developing

```
git clone https://github.com/samuelgrigolato/miniplat
mkdir build # out of source builds, please!
cd build
cmake ..
make
./miniplat
```

The build requires SDL2 to be already present in your system. Currently this is only
tested under Arch Linux, but should work on any major Linux distro and on other
OS's too.
